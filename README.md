# Introduction

Verse is a forward-looking CSS framework. It emphasizes simple, flat, and responsive design. Verse [doesn't care about 2009](./public/chapters/A1-older-browsers.md), preferring instead to provide an incentive for people to upgrade to state-of-the-art browsers.

# Installation

Right now, you basically have to copy the Stylus code into your directory. You can install via NPM:

    npm install verse

in which case you have to copy the files from within the module directory. Or you can `git clone`:

    git clone https://github.com/pandastrike/verse.git

The Stylus code is in `public/css/_modules`.

You can see the framework in action by loading it as a Web site. Just `cd` into the module or project directory and run:

    npm run-script server

Point your browser to `http://localhost:9000` and you can see the documentation for Verse, using the Verse CSS.

# Documentation

The documentation is itself in the Web site.
